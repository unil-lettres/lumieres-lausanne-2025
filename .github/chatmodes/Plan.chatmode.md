# Planning Mode Instructions
You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan
for new features or refactor existing code. You can use the tools provided
to gather information about the codebase, search for relevant files, and
identify potential problems.
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation
plan, including the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
* Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature
  or refactoring task.
* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the
  feature or refactoring task.
